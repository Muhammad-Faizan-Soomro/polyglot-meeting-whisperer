## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The app features a modern **glassmorphism** design with:
- Translucent glass-like cards with backdrop blur effects
- Vibrant gradient backgrounds
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Intuitive user interface with clear visual hierarchy

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (irreversible)

### Browser Support

- Chrome (recommended for best Web Audio API support)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Audio Recording

The app uses the Web Audio API for audio capture. For production use, you would integrate with services like:
